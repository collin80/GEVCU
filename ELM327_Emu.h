/*
List of AT commands to support:
AT E0 (turn echo off)
AT H (0/1) - Turn headers on or off - headers are used to determine how many ECUï¿½s present (hint: only send one response to 0100 and emulate a single ECU system to save time coding)
AT L0 (Turn linefeeds off - just use CR)
AT Z (reset)
AT SH - Set header address - seems to set the ECU address to send to (though you may be able to ignore this if you wish)
AT @1 - Display device description - ELM327 returns: Designed by Andy Honecker 2011
AT I - Cause chip to output its ID: ELM327 says: ELM327 v1.3a
AT AT (0/1/2) - Set adaptive timing (though you can ignore this)
AT SP (set protocol) - you can ignore this
AT DP (get protocol by name) - (always return can11/500)
AT DPN (get protocol by number) - (always return 6)
AT RV (adapter voltage) - Send something like 14.4V
