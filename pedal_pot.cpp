the brake only really uses one variable input and uses different parameters

story time: this code will start at ThrottleMaxRegen when applying the brake. It
will do this even if you're currently flooring it. The accelerator pedal is ignored

not be possible to go racing down the road with a stuck accelerator. As soon as the
