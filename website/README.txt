The GEVCU uses the Mini Socket iWifi module from ConnectOne. Documentation can be found at

To update the website on the iChip, you have to use their packing tool which is part of their iChipConfig utility and only runs on Windows XP.  If you use Windows 7 you can use Windows XP mode:

Download and install the following:

Then to update the website after changes,

1. Launch iChipConfig, click through warnings about not having the com port and limited functionality
2. Choose the "Site Pack" tool
3. Browse to the website/src dir, select the index.htm as default
4. Select "C02128" as the platform and click "Pack". At this point the parameters should show.
5. Select all the parameters, enter 30 for the max length value to fill and click "Fill"
6. Click "Save" and point it to website.img

At this point you upload the image to the GEVCU using http://192.168.3.10/ichip and power cycle the GEVCU to have it activated.



What about the "WEB-INF" folder? 

If you are developing the website and want to test it locally with an Apache Tomcat server, just deploy the contents of website/src to
your webapps directory and copy the WEB-INF folder also there. This way Tomcat recognizes the webapp and also uses a filter to replace
the placeholders in certain .js files with meaningful data. The WEB-INF folder is deliberately not included in the website/src folder
because the ichip packaging tool would pick-up all its files too and the website would become bigger than 256kB.
