<h2>ABOUT GEVCU 4.02</h2>
<p />
Version 1.00003
<p />
The Generalized Electric Vehicle Control Unit - GEVCU is an open source
software and hardware project to develop a Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) specifically
for electric vehicles. Following the OEM automotive model, standardized
components are used in multiple cars, with a single component (VCU)
containing software to integrate operation of those components
specifically for that make and model vehicle.
<p />
The purpose of GEVCU is to handle throttle control, regenerative
braking, and such peculiarities as precharge, cooling system control,
instrumentation etc. - essentially the driver interface of the car.
GEVCU then manages torque and speed commands to the power electronics
via CAN bus to actually operate the vehicle in response to driver input.
But it also provides outputs to instrumentation, cooling systems, and
other controls specific to that vehicle.
<p />
GEVCU is both open-source and object-oriented allowing easy addition of
modules to incorporate multiple standard power components. It is easily
modified to incorporate additional features peculiar to any electric car
conversion or build. For most operations, it is easily configurable by
non-programmers to adapt to a wide variety of power components and
vehicle applications.
<p />
GEVCU is designed to operate on any Arduino Due hardware with two CANbus
channels and appropriate analog and digital inputs and outputs.
<p />
GEVCU was originally conceived of and proposed by Jack Rickard of
Electric Vehicle Television (http://EVtv.me) who wrote the original
design specification. 
<p />
The main source of the program was developed and
is maintained by Collin Kidder and the latest version is always
available at http:/github.com/collin80/GEVCU.  A list of major contributors to the project is maintained there.
<p />
Hardware was designed and developed by Ed Clausen and Paulo Almeida
<p />
GEVCU is open source and classified EXPERIMENTAL - USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK. It is offered strictly for experimental and educational
purposes and is NOT intended for actual use in any commercial product
for any specific useful purpose.
