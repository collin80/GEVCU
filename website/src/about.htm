<h2>ABOUT GEVCU 4.041</h2>
<p />

<p />
The Generalized Electric Vehicle Control Unit - GEVCU is an open source
software and hardware project to develop a Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) specifically
for electric vehicles. 
<p />
The purpose of GEVCU is to handle throttle control, regenerative
braking, forward, reverse, and such peculiarities as precharge, cooling system control,
instrumentation etc. - essentially the driver interface of the car.
<p />
GEVCU then manages torque and speed commands to the power electronics
via CAN bus to actually operate the vehicle in response to driver input.
<p />
But it also provides outputs to instrumentation, brake lights, reverse lights, cooling systems, and other controls specific to that vehicle.
<p />
GEVCU is both open-source and object-oriented allowing easy addition of
additional C++ object modules to incorporate multiple standard power components. 
It is easily modified using the Arduino IDE to incorporate additional features 
peculiar to any specific electric car conversion or build.
<p />
For most operations, it is easily configurable by non-programmers through
simple web and serial port interfaces to adapt to a wide variety of power 
components and vehicle applications.
<p />
GEVCU was originally conceived of and proposed by Jack Rickard of
Electric Vehicle Television (http://EVtv.me) who wrote the original
design specification. 
<p />
The main source of the program was developed and is maintained by Collin Kidder
and the latest version is always available at http:/github.com/collin80/GEVCU.
A list of major contributors to the project is maintained there.
<p />
Hardware was designed and developed by Ed Clausen and Paulo Almeida based on the 
Arduino Due.
<p />
GEVCU is open source hardware and software and is presented as EXPERIMENTAL - USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK. It is offered strictly for experimental and educational
purposes and is NOT intended for actual use in any commercial product
or for any specific useful purpose.
