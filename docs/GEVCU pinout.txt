Pin 1 - +12V Input
Pin 3 - +12V output for first digital input
Pin 7 - EXT GND connection to chassis ground / Battery - (in my case)
Pins 9 & 10 - First canbus
Pin 19 - Gnd connection for first and second analog inputs (Throttle)
Pin 20 - First analog input (Throttle)
Pin 21 - Second analog input (Throttle)
Pin 22 - Third analog input (brake / testing input for me)
Pin 23 - Fourth analog input (test pot on my wires)
Pin 24 - +5V power for first and second analog inputs (Throttle)
Pin 26 - +5V power for third and fourth analog inputs (test pots for me,
probably brake transducer for you)
Pin 30 - Gnd connection for third and fourth analog inputs (Brake / Testing)
Pin 32 - First digital input. Tied to pin 3 above through a switch

I used a gnd at pin 19 for one of the gnds. It really doesn't matter
which one you use. All four (19,29,30,31) are equivalent.
