Generalized Electric Vehicle Control Unit


A project to create a fairly Arduino compatible ECU firmware
to interface with various electric vehicle hardware over canbus
(and possibly other comm channels)

The project now builds in the Arduino IDE. So, use it to compile, send the firmware
to the Arduino, and monitor serial. It all works very nicely.

The master branch of this project is now switched to support the Due. The older Macchina
code has been moved to its own branch. ArduinoDue branch will be bleeding edge and pushed
to the master branch when future revisions yield known good configurations. At this point the master
branch does work for motor control without need for a PC.

You will need the following to have any hope of compiling and running the firmware:
- An Arduino Due. This should be obvious.
- A canbus shield. You can make it or you can wait... sorry...
- Arduino IDE 1.5.2 or newer
- due_can library - There is a repo for this under Collin80
- due_rtc library - I have a repo for this too
- due_wire library - once again, in my repos
- DueTimer library - and again

All libraries belong in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries (Windows) or ~/Arduino/libraries (Linux/Mac).
You will need to remove -master or any other postfixes. Your library folders should be named as above.
Below is what the folder contents look like on my machine (you don't need all of these libraries,
just the ones above)

Audio (not needed)
due_can (needed)
due_rtc (needed)
due_wire (needed)
DueTimer (needed)
Ethernet (not needed)
Scheduler (not needed)
Servo (not needed)
SPI (not needed)
USBHost (not needed)
WiFi (not needed)
Wire (not needed)

The canbus is supposed to be terminated on both ends of the bus. If you are testing with a DMOC 
and Due then you've got two devices, each on opposing ends of the bus. So, both really should be
terminated but for really short canbus lines you will probably get away with terminating just one side.
If you are using a custom board then add a terminating resistor. If you are using the new prototype shield
then it should already be terminated. The DMOC can be terminated by soldering a 120 ohm resistor 
between the canbus lines. I did this on my DMOC and hid the resistor inside the plug shroud.
