 New, new plan: Allow for an arbitrary # of devices that can have both tick and canbus handlers. These devices register themselves
 into the handler framework and specify which sort of device they are. They can have custom tick intervals and custom can filters.
 The system automatically manages when to call the tick handlers and automatically filters canbus and sends frames to the devices.
 There is a facility to send data between devices by targetting a certain type of device. For instance, a motor controller
 can ask for any throttles and then retrieve the current throttle position from them.

Random comments on things that should be coded up soon:
4. It is a possibility that there should be support for actually controlling the power to some of the devices.
    For instance, power could be controlled to the +12V connection at the DMOC so that it can be power cycled
    in software. But, that uses up an input and people can just cycle the key (though that resets the GEVCU too)
5. Some people (like me, Collin) have a terrible habit of mixing several coding styles. It would be beneficial to
    continue to harmonize the source code - Perhaps use a tool to do this.
6. It should be possible to limit speed and/or torque in reverse so someone doesn't kill themselves or someone else
    while gunning it in reverse - The configuration variable is there and settable now. Just need to integrate it.
7. The DMOC code duplicates a bunch of functionality that the base class also used to implement. We've got to figure
    out where the overlaps are and fix it up so that as much as possible is done generically at the base MotorController
    class and not directly in the Dmoc class.
