 New, new plan: Allow for an arbitrary # of devices that can have both tick and canbus handlers. These devices register themselves
 into the handler framework and specify which sort of device they are. They can have custom tick intervals and custom can filters.
 The system automatically manages when to call the tick handlers and automatically filters canbus and sends frames to the devices.
 There is a facility to send data between devices by targetting a certain type of device. For instance, a motor controller
 can ask for any throttles and then retrieve the current throttle position from them.

Changelog (Update with very brief message along with build # - Dates wouldn't hurt either
Sept 9 2013:
1000 - First build # enabled build - Comment out hard coded line for # of throttles
1001 - Proper fix for issue corrected by build 1000
1002 - Show build # on startup and in menu
1003 - Implementation of RC precharging mode for motor controller
Sept 12 2013:
1004 - Change some variables in brake to 32 bit
1005 - bug fix in in ichip routines
Sept 19 2013:
1006 - Added ability to configure debugging output - switched DeviceManager to not create null objects
1007 - Allow the DMOC to start up ready to go. It now must be explicitly disabled via the second digital input
1008 - Implement (initial support) reverse limit, switch brake to using indep. min value, get existing values settable with serial console
1009 - Implemented message passing and hooked up the rest of the code to use it.
1010 - Support for GEVCU3 boards
1011 - Added support for Think City battery packs with BMS
1012 - Tons of changes to MotorController and SerialConsole

/*
Random comments on things that should be coded up soon:
1. Wifi code needs to be finished. It should read in settings from EEPROM, etc. And start up a webserver. Then
the code should scan for changed parameters occassionally and set them in eeprom
2. Serial console needs to be able to set the wifi stuff
3. Most of the support code for precharge based on RC is done. But, it still must be tested. Also, it should
	check to see if the motor controller reports voltage and make sure the voltage is reported at least up
	to the set nominal voltage before closing the main contactor. If it takes too long then fault and open
	everything. Also, open contactors in case of a serious fault (but not for just any fault. Opening contactors under load can be nasty!)
4. It is a possibility that there should be support for actually controlling the power to some of the devices.
	For instance, power could be controlled to the +12V connection at the DMOC so that it can be power cycled
	in software. But, that uses up an input and people can just cycle the key (though that resets the GEVCU too)
5. Some people (like me, Collin) have a terrible habit of mixing several coding styles. It would be beneficial to
	continue to harmonize the source code - Perhaps use a tool to do this.
6. It should be possible to limit speed and/or torque in reverse so someone doesn't kill themselves or someone else
	while gunning it in reverse - The configuration variable is there and settable now. Just need to integrate it.
7. The DMOC code duplicates a bunch of functionality that the base class also used to implement. We've got to figure
	out where the overlaps are and fix it up so that as much as possible is done generically at the base MotorController
	class and not directly in the Dmoc class.
