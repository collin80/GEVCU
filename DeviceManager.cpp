/*
 * DeviceManager.cpp
 *
 The device manager keeps a list of all devices which are installed into the system.
 Anything that needs either a tick handler, a canbus handler, or to communicate to other
 devices on the system must be registered with the manager. The manager then handles
 making sure the tick handler is set up (if needed), the canbus handler is set up (if need),
 and that a device can send information to other devices by either type (BMS, motor ctrl, etc)
 or by device ID.

 The device class itself has the handlers defined so the tick and canbus handling code
 need only call these existing functions but the manager interface needs to
 expose a way to register them with the system.
